# Product Guidelines: Ghana School Bot

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Academic:** The system should communicate in a clear, formal, and authoritative manner, maintaining the standards of an educational environment.
- **Supportive & Direct:** While being professional, the voice should remain helpful and guide users through complex AI-driven tasks without unnecessary jargon.

## Brand Values
- **Accuracy & Reliability:** Every curriculum-aligned resource generated or categorized by the system must be high-quality and verified. Reliability is the cornerstone of the platform.
- **Educational Empowerment:** The product exists to simplify and enhance the teaching and learning experience in Ghana.

## Visual Identity (Redesign Standards)
- **Palette:** Implement a **solid-subtle-dark** color palette. Avoid gradients and excessive glassmorphism.
- **Layout:** Use a **Tabbed Interface** for categorized views (Overview, Process, Resources, Settings).
- **Navigation:** Implement localized **Area Scrolling** for logs and file lists to maintain a compact, single-page dashboard feel.
- **Icons:** Use consistent SVG icons (e.g., Lucide-react) instead of emojis to maintain a professional aesthetic.
- **Typography:** Prioritize readability with a consistent font scale and clear information hierarchy.

## Interaction & UX Patterns
- **Real-Time Feedback:** All background processes (scraping, AI generation, syncing) must provide real-time status updates via progress bars and live logs.
- **Modal Consistency:** Modals should be used for previews and deep configuration, following a standardized design across the application.
- **Error Handling:** Errors should be communicated clearly with actionable next steps, especially for configuration or API-related issues.
